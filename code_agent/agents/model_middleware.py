"""Dynamic model selection middleware for deepagents.

Implements the LangChain-recommended pattern for selecting a model at runtime:
a ``wrap_model_call`` middleware reads the model id from invocation context,
resolves it through the config-driven provider registry
(:mod:`code_agent.providers.registry`), and builds a concrete model
on-the-fly. There are no hardcoded provider names here — the provider,
base_url and api_key all follow from the model's entry in the ``providers``
block of ``config/codeagent.jsonc``.

This avoids rebuilding the agent on every model switch — the agent is built
once with a default model, and the middleware transparently swaps the model
per-invocation based on the context passed by the caller (web UI or TUI).
