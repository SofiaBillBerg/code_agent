# Features

This page provides a detailed overview of the features available in `code_agent`.

## Core Features

`code_agent` is built around a few core concepts that make it a powerful and flexible tool for local development.

### 1. Project Scaffolding
Start new Python projects in seconds with the `scaffold` command. `code_agent` generates a complete, modern project
structure, so you can start coding right away.

The generated scaffold includes:
- A `src` directory for your package source code.
- A `tests` directory with a sample smoke test.
- A `docs` directory ready for Quarto documentation.
- A pre-configured `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for continuous integration.
- Standard configuration files like `requirements.txt` and `README.qmd`.

### 2. File Generation and Manipulation
`code_agent` provides a rich set of utilities for programmatic file I/O, accessible via the Python API or the
interactive agent.
- **Create and Write Files**: Easily create new files or overwrite existing ones.
- **Append Content**: Add content to the end of existing files.
- **Template-Based Generation**: Create files from templates with variable substitution.
- **Python to Notebook Conversion**: The `py2ipynb` CLI command converts Python scripts with `#%%` cell markers into
  Jupyter notebooks.

### 3. LLM-Powered Interactive Agent
The heart of `code_agent` is its intelligent agent, which uses a local LLM (via Ollama by default) to understand and
respond to natural language commands. The agent can:
- **Generate and Explain Code**: Create new functions, classes, or entire modules, and explain how they work.
- **Automate Testing**: Generate `pytest` test files for your source code.
- **Orchestrate Tools**: Combine its tools to perform complex, multistep tasks based on your requests.
- **Maintain Context**: The agent remembers previous turns in the conversation, allowing for iterative development
  workflows.

### 4. Extensible Toolset
The agent's capabilities are defined by its tools. `code_agent` comes with a powerful set of built-in tools for file
I/O, code formatting, and analysis. It's designed to be easily extended with your own custom tools. See the *
*[Tools](TOOLS.qmd)** page for a full list and instructions on how to create your own.

## Architecture Overview

`code_agent` has a modular architecture built on top of LangChain and LangGraph.

**Key Components:**

- **User Interface**: Provides both a command-line interface (`cli.py`) for direct commands and an interactive chat
  loop (`main.py`).
- **Agent Core**: The central component that defines the agent's logic. `base_agent.py` creates the tools, and
  `graph.py` orchestrates the flow of control between the LLM and the tools.
- **LLM & Memory**: The agent uses an LLM (e.g., `ChatOllama`) for reasoning and a `Chroma` vector store to maintain
  conversational memory.
- **Core Utilities**: A set of modules that provide the fundamental building blocks, such as file I/O and project
  scaffolding.
