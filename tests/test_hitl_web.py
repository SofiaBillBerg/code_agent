    This  class tests the core HITL resume functionality.
    These tests verify the core behavior of the /chat/resume endpoint

    Note: This tests the web API layer, not the SSE stream logic directly.
    The web layer delegates to the SSE stream logic via _pending_hitl and _hitl_decisions.
    See `test_sse_stream.py` for tests of the actual SSE stream behavior.
    See `test_hitl_web.py` for tests of the web API layer.
    See `test_hitl_integration.py` for integration tests.
    See `test_hitl_unit.py` for unit tests of the core logic.
