A log of the meaningful changes to the `code-agent` project.

## v0.2.0 (Current)

- **Refactored Core Logic to use LangGraph**: The agent's control flow is now managed by a `StateGraph`, providing a
  more robust and transparent orchestration of tools and LLM calls.
- **Expanded Toolset**: Added several new tools, including `read-file`, `format-code`, `generate-test`, and `r-script`,
  significantly increasing the agent's capabilities.
- **Local-First Focus**: Solidified the project's commitment to local-only operation. Removed all references to external
  APIs like OpenAI and clarified the use of `Ollama` and `GPT4AllEmbeddings` as the default local providers.
- **Persistent Memory**: Integrated `ChromaDB` to provide persistent conversational memory, allowing the agent to recall
  context from previous sessions.
- **Improved CLI**: The command-line interface, built with `Typer`, now includes a `chat` command for the interactive
  agent session, in addition to utilities like `scaffold` and `py2ipynb`.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Overhauled the entire documentation to be specific to `code-agent`, with detailed
  guides on features, tools, and architecture.

## v0.1.0

- **Initial Release**: First version of the project.
- **Core Components**: Included basic file I/O, project scaffolding, and a simple agent structure.
- **Basic LLM Integration**: Initial support for using an LLM to drive agent actions.
