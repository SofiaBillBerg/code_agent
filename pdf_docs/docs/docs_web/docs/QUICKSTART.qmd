This guide provides the essential steps to get `code_agent` installed and running on your local machine.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**: Ensure you have a modern version of Python installed.
- **`uv` or `pip`**: A Python package manager. `uv` is recommended for its speed.
- **Ollama**: For the agent's LLM capabilities, you need [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running. You also
  need to have a model pulled. We recommend starting with `llama3`.
  ```bash
  ollama pull llama3
  ```

## 2. Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/code_agent.git
cd code_agent
```

Next, create a virtual environment and install the package in editable mode. Including the `[dev]` dependencies is
recommended for development.

```bash
# Create and activate the virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package
uv pip install -e .[dev]
```

## 3. Configuration

Before running the agent, make sure your `code_agent/config/llm_config.json` is set up to use the model you have
downloaded. For example:

```json
{
  "ollama_model": "llama3",
  "temperature": 0.7
}
```

## 4. Basic Usage

You can now use `code_agent` directly from your terminal.

### Interactive Chat

The primary way to use the agent is through the interactive chat session.

```bash
code-agent chat
```

You can now give instructions to the agent in plain English:
> "Create a Python file named 'app.py' and add a simple Flask 'Hello, World!' application to it."

### Project Scaffolding

To create a new, well-structured Python project, use the `scaffold` command.

```bash
code-agent scaffold my-new-project --name MyProject
```

This will generate a new directory `my-new-project` with a recommended layout for source code, tests, and documentation.
