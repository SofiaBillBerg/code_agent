# Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving
documentation, your help is appreciated. Please read the following guidelines to get started.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork locally.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/code_agent.git
   cd code_agent
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**: We recommend using `uv` to create and manage your virtual environment.
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the package in editable mode with all development dependencies.
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Code Style & Linting

We use `ruff` for linting and formatting. Before committing your changes, please run the following command to ensure
your code adheres to the project's style guidelines.

```bash
ruff check --fix .
ruff format .
```

- All public functions, classes, and methods should have clear docstrings.
- Follow standard Python naming conventions (PEP 8).

## Testing

The project uses `pytest` for testing.

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Run tests with coverage**:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=code_agent
  ```

Please add tests for any new features or bug fixes to ensure that the codebase remains stable and reliable.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-new-feature
   ```
2. Make your changes, add tests, and ensure all checks pass locally.
3. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
4. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git push origin my-new-feature
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request from your fork to the main `code_agent` repository.
6. In the PR description, please explain the changes you have made and reference any related issues.
